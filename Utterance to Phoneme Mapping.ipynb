The LAS model consists of two components: a listener and a speller. The listener is a pyramidal RNN encoder that accepts filter phonemes as inputs. The speller is an attention-based recurrent network decoder that emits characters as outputs.\n","The listener, which is a pyramidal RNN, converts low-level speech signals into higher-level features and it is done using a pyramid BLSTM (pBLSTM). In each successive stacked pBLSTM layer, the time resolution is reduced by a factor of 2; this allows the model to handle longer sequences and capture more complex patterns in the data.\n","\n","## How to run my code: \n","\n","In brief, the aims of this work was to teach us how to solve sequence-to-sequence problems using sequence models. I got to learn how to set up GRU/LSTM models on PyTorch, use CNNs as feature extractors, handle sequential data, pad/pack batches of variable length data, train the model using CTC Loss, optimize the model, and implement decoders such as greedy and beam decoders. I got to also explore various architectures and hyperparameters to find the optimal solution and learn how to stage data to efficiently search through the space of solutions. Finally, I learnt how to use objects from the PyTorch framework to build a GRU/LSTM based model and deal with issues of data loading, memory usage, and arithmetic precision to maximize the time efficiency of training and inference.I learned hyperparameter tuning to ensure that the model perform well.\n","\n","To fulfill the requirement of this project while achieving the high cutt off accuracy, different steps were taken into consideration like hyperparameter tuning.\n","\n","Hyperparameters used and resulted in the best score are:\n","Around 200 epochs used, batch_size of 32, learning rate of 3e-3 and others as stated in configs cell\n","\n","Data loader functions were implemented to help in loading the data both training, validation and testing set.\n","## Results\n","Valid_distance locally: 5.244\n","Test distance on kaggle (public score): 5.58\n","Test distance on kaggle (private score): 5.80\n","\n","## code running\n","\n","To ensure the code are running, Kaggle is in use with GPU runtime, data are downloaded from kaggle, checkpoints are saved in kaggle/working directory.\n","you run the code cells from the beginning, no cell will be skipped.\n","\n","To reload checkpoint, you uncomment codes in cell 59 which contain code to load checkpoints and load the path to the checkpoint and run the cell.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UR4qfYrVoO4v"},"source":["#
